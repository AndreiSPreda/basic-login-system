# basic-login-system
One of my projects

firstly, you need to create 2 databases in your php my admin
1.Enter in your localhost
2.Click on phpMyAdmin
3.Create 2 new databases, one named 'dots' and one named 'db_users'
4.Run mysql_create_acc.php and mysql_create_dots.php, now you can add from there your dots on the map, and when entering login.php you need to create accounts first.
Now you are good to go.
